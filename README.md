# Programming-with-Go

This repository contains go scripts that were used to complete the [Programming with Google Go Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/google-golang) through Coursera.

This specialization introduced the Go programming language from Google and provided learners with an overview of Go's special features. Upon completing the three-course sequence, I have gained the knowledge and skills needed to create concise, efficient, and clean applications using Go.
